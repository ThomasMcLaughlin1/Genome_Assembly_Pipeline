# Data
# stage 1 merging data 
- Input files were compressed fasta.gz files of nanopore and illumina reads. Merged output files 
  were also in fasta.gz format

# stage 2 - assment of the quality of the reads 
- Both input and output files were in fasta.gz format

# stage 3 - Genome assembly 
- Input files were in fasta.gz. Assmbled genomes were no longer in compressed gz format and were 
  .fa fasta files

# stage 4 - PROKKA annotation
- The input files for prokka were the .fa genome assemblies.
- PROKKA annotation produced the following output files

- .err Standard error output
- .log step by step of what prokka did
- .ffn fasta file of nucleotide sequences 
- .fsa fasta of whole genome 
- .gff General feature format - includes all annotations in one file
- .sqn sequin file. Binary file containing nucleotide sequences of contigs, anntoations and any 
   meta data such as organism name associated with the annotation
- .tsv tab serparted summary of features
- .faa fasta of protein sequences
- .fna nucleotide fasta of contigs
- .gbk Genbank file format 
- .tbl feature table 
- .txt summary of annotation results

# stage 5 - quast comparative analysis
- Pass, fail and all long read .fasta assembly files were compared to short and hybrid .fasta 
  assemblies
- Quast comparative analysis produced the following output files and folders

files
- report.html Interactive HTML report with plots
- report.pdf 
- report.txt
- report.tsv
- transposed_report.tsv metrics as rows instead of columns.
- transposed_report.txt
- icarus.html

folders
- basic_stats/
- genome_stats/
- contigs_reports/
- aligned_stats/
- icarus_viewers/ files used by the icarus browser

# stage 6
- The prokka .gbk file was used as an input into genovi
- To visualise the prokka annotation in artemis the prokka .gbk and .gff were used

- Genovi's output consisted of the following files
- genovi.svg & genovi.png represented the circular genome plot
- genovi-contig_*.sv / .png were individual contig plots
- genovi_COG_Classification.csv
- genovi_COG_Classification_percentages.csv
- genovi_COG_Classification.csv_percentage.png
- genovi_COG_Histogram.png
- genovi_Gral_Stats.csv

# stage 7 mapping short reads back to refernece
- The reference HaloferaxVolcanii.fasta along with the merged foward and reverse .fasta.gz reads 
  were inputed to BWA

- BWA produced the following index files
- .amb stores ambiguous bases
- .ann contains refernce sequence names, lenghths and positions
- .bwt contains the burrows wheeler transform of the refernce
- .pac compressed version of the refence, bases are encoded 2 bits per base 
- .sa contains indexes of all possible suffixes of the refernce 

- The alignemnt files produced by BWA consisted of
- aln-pe.sam
- aln-pe.sam.gz

- The sam file was compressed to a bam file using samtools
- aln-pe.bam

# stage 8
- Merged pass.fasta.gz were inputted into minmap2 to generate a .mmi index of the reads
- minimap2 then produced .sam file from the inputted .mmi index of the pass reads and the reference 
 .fasta
- This produced a .sam file conatining the reads mapped back to the reference
- This file was then converted to a bam file, which was sorted and 
  indexed by samtools

# stage 9
- Sorted and indexed bam file of reads mapped back to reference was visualised in IGV
